# Interactive rating component

## Brief

My challenge was to build an interactive rating component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## The challenge

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size;
- See hover states for all interactive elements;
- Select and submit a number rating;
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating.
